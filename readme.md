# Seth goes mobile

Seth wants a mobile app for his blog. Let's crowdsource it!

It is still ugly, buggy, etc, but at the same time open source and somehow cross platform. Better design would be nice.

## Technologies

* Node v0.6.17
* Express v3.0.0rc2
* CoffeeScript! v1.3.3
* Jade v0.26.0
* Connect Assets v2.2.1

Based on [express-coffee](https://github.com/twilson63/express-coffee)

## Roadmap?

* PhoneGap
* Better UI/UX
* Sockets (?)
